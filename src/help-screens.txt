  The aim of the game is to  find  all
  mines.
  
  If you left-click on  a  field,  the
  number of adjacent fields with mines
  is revealed. If you right-click on a
  field, it is marked as a  mine,  but
  the game won't tell  you  if  you're
  right. When you have marked all  the
  mines and no  other  fields,  you've 
  won the game.

  But be careful: If you left-click on
  field with a mine, it  explodes  and
  you loose a life. When you  have  no
  more lives left, you have  lost  the 
  game.

  If you are using a  joystick,  press
  fire to left-click and F7 to  right-
  click.

  In this modern version, you  have  a
  wide variety of game modes to choose
  from: 
   - square or hexagonal fields
   - four map sizes
   - three difficulty levels

  The mines  counter  shows  how  many 
  mines would be  left  if  all  marks 
  were correct. This can  be  negative
  if you mark more fields  than  there
  are mines.

  This game was originally released as
  part of our demo More Than Meets the 
  Eye in 1992. 
  
  You played on  a  10x10  square  map
  with 16 mines. Clicking on  a  field 
  with no adjacent mines didn't reveal
  its neighbors and the mines  display
  counted up.

  You can still play that  version  by
  pressing F5 at the title screen.
